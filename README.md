# VLC---Access-Error-Duplication
For duplicating the Access Error crash I'm seeing using VLC dialog callbacks.
In all of my tests this crashes when attempting to connect to a stream that requires authorization with the message:
The program '[0x4250] AccessErrorReproduction.vshost.exe' has exited with code -1073741819 (0xc0000005) 'Access violation'.
